Hi! I'm Alexia new full-stack developer who just graduated from Le Wagon Tokyo (batch #1188). 😀
I love to bring ideas to life through code. 💫

- 💻 I am currently improving old projects (JoyJot, WalkyWoofs)
- 🍷 I am planning to make an app to manage my dad's wine cave. 
- 📚 I am planning to learn docker and react
- 🌟 My current skills are: Ruby, Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, SQL and more...
